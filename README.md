# Apteco-Task

This is a project developed using React as an example task based on this code challenge; https://github.com/Apteco/ExampleFrontEndTask.

To run this application, clone the repository locally and run npm install, then npm start. 
Tests can be run with npm test.

Future development:
My next plans are to add sorting functionality to the table of results and to separate the data from app.js.
Once this is done I will add styling and refactor.
